      "why_elect": "I believe the council exists to empower our community rather than to direct it. To properly represent our community, I believe elected representatives need to be in our community, working alongside our people to tackle problems and develop opportunities together. These beliefs provide a good foundation to represent our community.",
      "why_stand": "Our region's efforts to earn income have come at the expense of diversity of employment for our people, economic stability in times of change and environmental costs. I believe we can broaden our approach to growth so that it improves the well-being of our community."

I have restored an old hotel so that is a thriving social hub for my community and I appreciate the challenges and opportunities for new businesses.",
      "why_stand": "I believe that Southland offers unique opportunities for a growing population of individuals and families seeking a better life. Identifying and encouraging the development of this potential is a key driver in securing a better future for our region and as mayor I would make this a priority."
