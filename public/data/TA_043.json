Drawing on my experience in communications, politics, and government relations, I'll make sure council is well run, listens to its community, and that we're top of mind for decision makers in Wellington.",
      "why_stand": "K\u0101piti is the best place in NZ to live, work, and raise a family, but growth from Transmission Gully is putting pressure on the relaxed beach lifestyle we all love. We can't stop people moving here, but if we make smart choices we can make growth work for us."
