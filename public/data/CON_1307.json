I can bring my skills to work collaboratively to find the balance we need to prosper whilst protecting the natural resources we care about."

      "why_stand": "Environment-Canterbury needs help. Pressured from all sides, with competing resource uses, it can seldom make everyone happy. Indeed ECan receives the most blame, for both doing too much and never enough. So I will help hear and represent community views, bringing fair balance to decisions where this is much needed."
