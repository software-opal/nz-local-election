      "why_elect": "Having spent 15 years in the charity sector here in Auckland, that has included supporting all types of wh\u0101nau through advocacy, education and more recently, in a general management role at Parenting Place. I believe I'm a suitable candidate because I'm accountability to my wh\u0101nau first, which keeps me grounded.",
      "why_stand": "Our healthcare system is similar to the life blood of our city. However, as a M\u0101ori male I've experienced the good, and especially the negative side of that system. I didn't see a young, proud M\u0101ori father on the board. So I'm putting my hand up as a representative."
