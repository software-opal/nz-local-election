My success throughout the region has demanded of me a high level of business acumen, the ability to negotiate significant contracts, understand local and central government complexities, and work with challenging budgets.",

      "why_elect": "I have many generations of working class history in Tasman. I would like to see us return to the \"good old days\" when anyone prepared to work hard could make a go of it. My background in running my own businesses gives me good understanding of how every dollar counts.",
      "why_stand": "I think Tasman is terrific! And everyone wants to live here. But, unfortunately, the Tasman lifestyle is out of most people's budgets. Wages are too low and the cost of living is too high for most young families and retirees. You deserve better representation to address the inequality in Tasman."
