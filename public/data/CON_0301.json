      "why_elect": "To make a good council representative, a person must have courage and determination. In Council, it is staff that often drive the agenda, and unfortunately most councillors sit back and do little to challenge that bureaucratic direction when needed. My track record shows I work for the people, not staff.",
      "why_stand": "I have spent the last 21 years interviewing, and listening to community members while filming and producing wildlife and environmental documentaries. I enjoy hearing about the issues that matter to people and I enjoy representing those people and their communities, offering a voice on their behalf."

Secondly, I always do my best to capture the genuine feelings of people. Thirdly, I adopt an honest, straight forward leadership style when representing those in Council.",
      "why_stand": "I am passionate about improving and protecting our environment while allowing for the continued economic expansion of our economy. I am passionate about finding smart, intelligent, innovative ways to do this because if we don't, none of us will win."
