      "why_elect": "I understand the importance of the RMA and Governance. The RMA demands a Healthy Environment, Vibrant Communities and a Strong Economy. The strong Economy has been neglected, and without \"serious regenerative\" money, our ambitions Environmentally and Socially will stall and fail.",
      "why_stand": "Waikato Region lacks good governance. Governance is about visionary leadership to set good policy for staff to carry out Rates and Compliance costs are rising unaffordably and exponentially. It is a Local Govt. and Govt. issue and needs to be addressed pragmatically, not bypassed."
