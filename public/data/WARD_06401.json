I enjoy the complexity of the councillor's role which involves a mixture of supporting local people/groups and developing council plans, strategies and policies.",

I have the time, energy, persistence and skills needed to perform the councillor's role; and I'm strongly motivated to making a positive difference for our community because I find this personally very satisfying."
