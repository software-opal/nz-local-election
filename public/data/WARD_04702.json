I can supply these: business owner, civil celebrant, union delegate, parent of two. I've studied NZ history, sailed the Pacific, lived overseas and learnt M\u0101ori. I'm proud to stand for council out west.",
      "why_stand": "In my view people living in Onslow-Western haven't had the option of supporting creative, caring, green, future-focused policies to grow Wellington. That's why I stood for council out west. I believe all individuals, families, and communities in our city need opportunities to live, contribute, and prosper."
